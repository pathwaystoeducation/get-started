# Welcome to the Pathways to Education Lab
We create + share technologies optimized for impact in the areas of youth well-being and education. 

Thank you for joining our product development team - we’re thrilled to have you on board as we build the future of education. Here are some notes and best practices to keep us in sync on this journey.

## Git Workflow
- Please share all code in as new repositories under the `pathwaystoeducation` Github, and use branches to work independently. New to Github? [Learn more here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- Commit early, and commit often; provide short, insightful commit messages that note what's being added/modified and why
  (e.g. "**Add UI for Login Page**", or "**Remove Extra Character to Fix #21**", referencing Github Issues if needed) 
- Always add as much documentation as possible - with comments in code, in readmes, wikis, etc.
- Create pull-requests and always review code before merging. This should at the very minimum be you reviewing your own code as a third party, but ideally involves at least one other member of the team

### Bug Fix Workflow
- Feedback is sent in email, slack, or other medium and should be logged as an Insight in ProductBoard
- Insights are collected and summarized weekly, and then logged as a Feature in ProductBoard. The colour next to the feature indicates current status
- When ready to be worked on, features are pushed as Issues to their respective Github repository
- When bugs are being worked on, the status should be changed in ProductBoard. A comment on a Github issue can suffice to let others know you’re working on it, and can serve as the log of proposed solution(s) and any blockers
- Code should be worked on in a separate branch based on the latest master, unless absolutely required otherwise
- Once the bug-fix is completed, please push the branch, rebasing off master if needed, and then create a pull-request with some brief information
